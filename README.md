# Le Coin Tracker
- Created by Me and my Friend!

Sources used: React with Vite. API from coinlore.

# What is this about?
It's a project that handles everything we've learned for react. Routing, Hooks, fetching, all of that in one place and from that we introduced: A Cryptotracker with its very own database(json).
Manipulatable with all CRUD Operations and it shows on a chart.

# What have I learned?
React is a huge help with States, Effects and more. I've understood, how react makes a website much better because of the routing options and all of the hooks it has to offer.
I can now use States, Effects, Params and much more and even create my own json database and take use of it.

Thanks for taking your time to read this! I wonder what my future me will create further.
