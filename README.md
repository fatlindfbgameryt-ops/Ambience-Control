# What is this about?
It's something small that I created throughout my holidays. The "chatbot" is also kind of rude, so yeah better don't use it:)
chatbot in "" because it just responds randomly with something from a chatlist.

# What have I learned?
This was the first time I really started to understand javascript more deeply. I became more comfortable with eventlisteners, I can casually think in steps, know how to use functions and generally learned to design better with html and css. So this is a very huge step for me, but obviously I will keep stepping till I master it like a professional!

Thanks for taking your time to read this! We'll see in the future, how much better I've become.
